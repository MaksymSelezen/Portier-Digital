                Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first
                comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid,
                or because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of
                failure you can never learn from, and such timidity will destroy
                you. The second kind comes from a bold and venturesome spirit.
              </p>

              <p class="text-page__text">
                If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your
                reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated
                failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute
                clarity how things must be done.

                In the future, the great division will be between those who have
                trained themselves to handle these complexities and those who
                are overwhelmed by them -- those who can acquire skills and
                discipline their minds and those who are irrevocably distracted
                by all the media around them and can enver focus enough to
                learn.

                We are all in search of feeling more connected to reality—to
                other people, the times we live in, the natural world, our
                character, and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly
                tends to separate us from these realities in various ways.

                We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or
                risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our
                daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to
                reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful
                way to feel this connection is through creative activity.

                Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever,
                because we are making something and not merely consuming.
                Masters of the small reality we create. In doing this work, we
                are in fact creating ourselves.
